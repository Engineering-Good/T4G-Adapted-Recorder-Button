# Adapted Recorder Button


<!--- SUMMARY --->
The Adapted Recorder Button  is an assistive button that also plays a prerecorded message up to 30 seconds long when the button is pressed. 
It has a diameter of 80-90mm and an activation force of roughly 250 grams. The Button  is made entirely with commercial, off the shelf parts, 
with no 3D printing involved. It has a similar functionality to the BIGmack and LITTLEmack buttons. This device is intended for users of assistive button 
who would benefit from or prefer additional audio feedback when using a switch. The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts. 
The overall cost of materials is about $8-10 (excluding component shipping fee).

The current version of the device (v1.0) has been built and user tested.
